            <p1>I have been married for almost 7 years to the most amazing person that I have ever met. We have two
                daughters and they are
                my whole world. My oldest love dressing up like Elsa and singing non-stop the music from the Frozen
                Movies. My youngest loves
                learning to walk and playing with her older sister. My wife loves being a "Play-at-home mom". She spends
                her days taking care of
                and teaching our children and I couldn't be more proud of her. I am employeed as a software developer
                for the Church in the Riverton
                Offic Building. I am working on my degree to futher my career path.
